Hello! 
This is my first time creating a server and routing between html pages and json data. 

The app is pretty basic, just hit "Start Survey" and fill out the form. Ideally, the modal should pop up with your Best Matched friend based on the sum of your answers. However, I am still struggling with the AJAX call to make this happen. 

You can navigate to the /api/friends url and you should see that your data has been entered. Also, in node, your best matched friend will show up based on the difference between your sum-total and their sum-total. 

You can see this app working on Heroku by following this link:

This was a fun challenge and I want to get it working 100% before I put it on my Porfolio Page.
